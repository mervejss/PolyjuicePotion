# PolyjuicePotion

Hermione wants to make a polyjuice potion again to find out if Draco is onto something. Now that she became an auror, she is kind of a pro in making one, and she has her own polyjuice essence. She only needs to mix it with castor oil, to make a perfect polyjuice. But there is a problem; the oil and essence are stored in bottles in her basement and whenever she opens a bottle she has to use it all. Therefore, during making the potion, she can add one bottle in each step.
